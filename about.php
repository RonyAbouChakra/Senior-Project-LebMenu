        Restaurants and coffee shops vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a 
        wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive 
        fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants,
         to high-priced luxury establishment
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="mx-4">
           All restaurants and coffee shops are subject to inspections
           by health inspectors to maintain standards for public health, 
           such as maintaining proper hygiene and cleanliness. 
           The most common kind of violations of inspection reports are those concerning 
           the storage of cold food at appropriate temperatures.

          All customers have some pre-conceived expectations about the restaurant
           before they visit it. Both Food and Service are essential for delivering excellent
            restaurant service to your valuable customers. The Restaurantâ€™s owners, managers, 
            and employees, all share the responsibility for ensuring that the customers are treated 
            professionally. Good restaurant service will help in leaving an overall positive impression 
            of an excellent dining experience and also help in retaining your customers.
